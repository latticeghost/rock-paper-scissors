# rock-paper-scissors
<p>This project is part of my learning to know how web applications work. Enjoy the game.</p>
<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
<p>1. The game starts with a prompt, asking you to enter either rock, paper or scissors (case insensitive).</p>
<p>2. The game consists of 5 rounds.</p>
<p>3. To view results of a single round & of the entire game, open console in your developer tools (F12 in most browsers or use shortcut keys) while you play the game.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>The game is designed to consider "rock", "paper" & "scissors" (case insensitive) as the only inputs in the prompt, typing anything else as input may result in unexpected results and behaviour.</p>
